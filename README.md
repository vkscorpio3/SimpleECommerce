# SimpleECommerce
This is a simple eCommerce application built using such frameworks; Spring MVC, Spring Core and Hibernate. It carries out simple crud functionalities. You can create unlimited top and parent classes, products which can have multiple categories and brands as well as each product can be associated with one brand. Most of front end work is done, however the code can be buggy, as I detected a few, so you are advised to work on bugs as well. This is only an example so use it at your disposal. In the hibernate properties file change database connection string and user credentials for your system.
